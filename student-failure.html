								<p>Brazil has historically struggled with respect to economic productivity and inequality. By looking at recent indicators one can come to the conclusion that both remain pressing problems to solve. In terms of economic development, superior education plays a key role. Public policy of the last couple of decades has aimed improving superior education through increasing investments, however the main obstacle has been the correct allocation of those investments. The project documented on this paper aims to aid the guidance of future policies through the creation of a model that can predict student performance as to assertively and reliably predict which students will pass or fail in the subjects they enroll as a tool for a better teaching management. Using machine learning methods, two prediction models have been developed, where one is a random forest model, and another is a logistic regression model. Both algorithmsâ€™ inner mechanisms differ in such a way that permitted a discussion of the characteristics important for each pointing to possible performance diagnosis hypotheses that could be explored in future investigations. Two main objectives guided the development and adjustment of both models: the identification of critical cases and the mapping of all student failures. In both cases the random forest model has shown better results, higher precision, and specificity. With 86% precision, the model demonstrated itself capable of predicting critical cases, as for the identification of all failures it has indicated sensitivity of 79% and 36% false positive rate, concluding that it may be useful for general application, but not reliable for specific cases. Therefore, the toolset produced and presented in the present paper generates reliable results and constitute an advancement in the capacity of academic performance interpretation as well as an example for other similar demands not yet attended in other universities and schools in the Brazilian educational landscape.</p>
